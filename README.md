# Making Interactive, Multi-User Environments with p5js and Socket.io

In this brief tutorial I'll cover how integrate web sockets (with socket.io) into a p5js sketch.

## Setting up a web server

First we'll set up a basic web server using nodejs. Nodejs is a "javascript runtime" that works out of the browser. This just means that you write code in javascript, but can run it from the terminal rather than inside Chrome or Firefox.

### Extremely quick introduction to nodejs

- Running `node`
- It's just javascript
- But with extra stuff

### Installing packages with npm

Make a new folder, and navigate to that folder in the terminal.

Before we create the server we'll set up a `package.json` file. This file contains the name of our project and a list of all of its depencies.

In the terminal type:

```
npm init
```

Give your project a name, and feel free to fill out the rest of the prompts, or just leave them blank. If you type `cd` you'll see a new file called `package.json` in the directory. You can open it up in a text editor (or just type `more package.json`) and you should see that it's just a json file.

The next step is to install expressjs - a simple web framework that will help us serve files. Express is a nodejs package. These packages can be installed with a tool that comes with nodejs called `npm` (the node package manager).

To install express, just type:

```
npm install express --save
```

This will install express. The `--save` means that npm will automatically update your `package.json` file with express listed as a project dependency. Type `more package.json` to see what I mean.

Now type `ls` (which shows you all the files in your current directory). You'll see a new folder called `node_modules`. This is where your npm packages are located. The folder was created automatically for you when you ran `npm install`.

Ok, so now we have expressjs installed, we can use it to make a very simple web server.

### Serving files with express

Create a new file called `server.js`, and paste this in:

```
var express = require('express')
var app = express();
var server = require('http').Server(app);

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Run the server by typing:

```
node server.js
```

(this is the part where I explain routes, and GET vs POST)

#### Static files

```
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

### Socket.io

Socket.io is library that uses a technology called web sockets to enable real-time communication between a client (your browser) and a server (in this case your nodejs server).

```
npm install --save socket.io
```

#### Super simple socket example
Note: socket.io is totally independent of p5js.

In `server.js`:

```
var express = require('express')
var app = express();
var server = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(server);

server.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000);

app.use(express.static('public'));

io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.emit('connected', {msg: "You're connected!"});
  socket.on('message', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    socket.broadcast.emit('message', data);
  });
});
```

In `index.html`:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.4.5.js"></script>
    <script>
      var socket = io.connect(window.location.origin);
      socket.on('message', function (data) {
        console.log(data.msg);
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Deploying to Heroku

### Create a git repository

create a .gitignore file and put this in it:
```
node_modules/
```

Initialize a git repo:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

### Create the Heroku instance

```
heroku create
```

Add a Procfile (Heroku needs this in order to know what to do with your server). Create a new file called Profile (no extension) and stick this in:

```
web: node server.js
```

Then commit your change to the git repo:

```
git add .
git commit -m 'added procfile for heroku'
```


### Deploy

```
git push heroku master
```
